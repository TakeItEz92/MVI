Library which allows to apply MVI architecture in your apps.

# Gratitude
Thanks to [Hannes Dorfmann's articles](http://hannesdorfmann.com/android/mosby3-mvi-1), I was inspired to implement my own library which allows you to crate reactive apps using RxJava and MVI architectural pattern.

# Concept
